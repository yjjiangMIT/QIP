% Main matlab routine to store phases in the global "calib" data
% structure; this is called by NMRRunPulseProg and NMRCalib
% after the spectra are taken.
%
% The calib data structure has a field calib.gphase which stores
% the phase reference data for the proton and carbon channels, in the
% format [h-freq-Mhz hph0 hph1; c-freq-Mhz cph0 cph1];
% BF1 = 200.13 MHz, BF2 = 50.32 MHz are the frequencies from  XWinNMR, 
% which may have to be changed every time the magnet is recharged 
%
% Modified 11-Mar-2014 by SPR. changed things so that the base frequencies
% are not just 200.0 and 50.0 all the time.
