% Description:  Makes a Bruker pulse program according to the arrays
% pulses, phases, delays.  The pulse program is saved as 
%
% Usage: write_pp( pulses, phases, delays, measure );
%
% pulses - 2xN array of pulses lengths where the first row
% represents the pulses on the hydrogen, and the second row
% represents the pulses on the carbon.  the pulse lengths are in
% terms of the 90 degree pulse length (ie. 1 = 90 degrees)
%
% phases - 2xN array of phases where the first row represents
% the phases of the hydrogen's pulses and the second row
% represents the phases of the carbon's pulses.  the phases
% are in units of 90 degrees (ie. 1 = 90 degrees )
%
% delays - 1xN array of delays in millisec.  the Nth delay follows 
% the Nth set of pulses on the two spins.
%
% measure - determines which nucleus is measured, 0 for
% hydrogen, 1 for carbon
%
% Example: write_pp( [2 1; 0 0], [0 0; 0 0], [100 0], 0 );
%
% This example performs an inversion-recovery sequence, 180-tau-90,
% on the first spin with tau = 100ms.  The fid of the hydrogen
% nucleus is measured.
